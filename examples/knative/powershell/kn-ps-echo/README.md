# kn-ps-echo
Simple Powershell function with an HTTP listener running in Knative to echo
[CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/).

> **Note:** CloudEvents using structured or binary mode are supported.

# Step 1 - Build

Create the container image and optionally push to an external registry such as Docker.

```
docker build -t <docker-username>/kn-ps-echo:1.0 .
docker push <docker-username>/kn-ps-echo:1.0
```

# Step 2 - Test

Verify the container image works by executing it locally.

```bash
docker run -e PORT=8080 -it --rm -p 8080:8080 <docker-username>/kn-ps-echo:1.0

# now in a separate window run the following

# Run either test.ps1 (PowerShell Script) or test.sh (Bash Script) to simulate a CloudEvent payload being sent to the container image
./test.ps1

Testing Function ...
See docker container console for output

# Step 3 - Deploy

> **Note:** The following steps assume a working Knative environment using the
`default` Rabbit broker. The Knative `service` and `trigger` will be installed in the
`vmware-functions` Kubernetes namespace, assuming that the broker is also available there.

Edit the `function.yaml` file with the name of the container image from Step 1 if you made any changes. If not, the default VMware container image will suffice and then deploy the function to VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA):

```bash
# Deploy function

kubectl -n vmware-functions apply -f function.yaml
```

For testing purposes, the `function.yaml` contains the following annotations, which will ensure the Knative Service Pod will always run **exactly** one instance for debugging purposes. Functions deployed through through the VMware Event Broker Appliance UI defaults to scale to 0, which means the pods will only run when it is triggered by an vCenter Event.

```yaml
annotations:
  autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "1"
  autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "1"
```

# Step 4 - Undeploy

```bash
# Undeploy function

kubectl -n vmware-functions delete -f function.yaml
```
